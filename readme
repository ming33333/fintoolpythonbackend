### Information from /search

The information returned from `/search` is in the `nasdaq_companies.csv` file located in the reference data folder.

### To do 
add contributions to yahoo fin library, the parse_json and the get_quote_table
 - get_quote_table is in div data-testid="quote-statistics", will have to figure out a new way from the function to capture the table data, bc the site no long uses the <table> tag, which is what the get_quote_table focuses this will also fix the get_stats(ticker) function

 need to use get_financial to grab debt for debt to equity ratio, but the parse json will not work, only works for get_earnings

### Future Feature

A feature must be added in the future to change the date of the ratio. Currently, only 4Q2024 data is being used.

#### Quarterly Results from `yf.get_earnings(symbol)['quarterly_results']`
